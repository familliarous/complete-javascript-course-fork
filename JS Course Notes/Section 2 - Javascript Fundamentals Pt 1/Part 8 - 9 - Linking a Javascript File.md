# [11/03/2025] Notes

- The developer console in modern browsers are just an environment to mostly execute pieces of code.
- Website Content should be separate from the JS logic. Inline JS is only good for short lines of code
- **VALUE** - smallest unit of information in JS. Stored in Variables

# JS Conventions

- **Standard JS case convention- camelCase**
- **Standard variable naming conventions as well: No var names starting with numbers, special characters. Only underscore, numbers, letters and dollar sign. No JS keywords either**
- name is a JS keyword, but can be used. Just don't to avoid complications
- Constants are all caps
- variable names should be descriptive.
