# 55. Setting up Prettier and VS Code

- You can use Prettier, an Opinionated js formatter, to configure the formatting of you JS code.
- It is also very configurable, all you need is a `.prettierrc` file to configure its settings (In JSON format).
- VSCode can help with SNIPPETS config: `File > Preferences > Configure Snippets > New global snippets file`.
- VSCode plugins of note:
	- Prettier
	- Auto Close Tag
	- ESLint
	- Image Preview
	- Monokai Pro (theme)
	- ~~Settings Sync~~ (DEPRECATED, use vscode built-in settings sync instead, already on for me.)
	- TODO Highlight
