# 72. PROJECT #1: Guess My Number!

- **Project Requirements:** You are to make a small Guess My Number app, where you guess the number. The app should let you know if the number you entered is higher or lower.
- Introduction to DOM:
	- `document.querySelector()`- Selects an element with the defined id or class name.
	- if it is an ID, you mark the parameter with a #. if it is a class, you mark it with a dot (.).
	- e.g.`document.querySelector(#firstInput)`
	- `.textContent()` - grabs the content.
